      <h3 class="paper-title"> Places and People Under Heterogeneous Federal Reserve Policy (Job Market Paper) </h3>
      <p class="paper-meta">(solo authored)</p>
      <p class="paper-abstract">
        I study the places (local labor markets) and people (workers) consequences of the Federal Reserve’s heterogeneous 
        policy response to the bank failures that occurred in Mississippi at the onset of the Great Depression. During 
        this period, the St. Louis district contracted its credit supply while the Atlanta district did the opposite&mdash;a 
        rare natural experiment in monetary policy implementation. By using a Regression Discontinuity design and randomization 
        inference, I show that (1) The bank failure rate was significantly smaller in the Atlanta district relative to the 
        St. Louis district. (2) There were economically and statistically significant long-term differences in labor market 
        outcomes and migration. Ten years after the initial shock, residents of the Atlanta district side of Mississippi 
        (place) were less likely to be unemployed, less likely to be in work relief, less likely to be in the labor force, 
        and had higher weekly income relative to their St. Louis counterparts. (3) By tracking individuals who were originally 
        near the boundary in 1930, I find that ten years later, individuals originally on the St. Louis side were more 
        likely to migrate. Importantly, for these individuals (people), most of the differences relative to their Atlanta-side 
        counterparts were mitigated, suggesting that migration served as a channel through which individuals could counteract 
        the negative shock faced by places on the St. Louis-side.

      <p class="paper-meta">(solo authored)</p>
      <p class="paper-abstract">
          Has Inflation Targeting been equally effective at reducing inflation across countries? 
          By exploiting the staggered nature of its adoption, and levering a synthetic control framework that accommodate 
          multiple treated units, I study both the average and heterogeneous effects of the policy worldwide. On average, 
          Inflation Targeting reduced inflation by about 3.1 percentage points per year, with this effect persisting for 
          at least 13 years. The impact has been widely heterogeneous, however, with most country-level effects ranging 
          from –1.3 to –6.2 percentage points per year.
